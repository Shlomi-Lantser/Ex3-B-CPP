# Matrix implementation C++

# Description
Implementation of matrix , included operators implementations.
The matrix has 3 private variables :
* rows
* cols
* vector <double>
  
# The goal:
  The goal of the project is to know how to implement some operators on C++ and know to use them for our goals.
  
Classes on this project :
                  
* **Matrix.hpp** - Functions and methods library.

* **Matrix.cpp** - Implementation of all the methods operators and functions.
                 
## Operators:
* `==` - Check if every element in the matrix is equal to the other.
* `!=` - Check if there is a different between the two matrices.
* `<` - Check if the first matrix is smaller then the other by sum of the element.
* `>` - Check if the first matrix is smaller then the other by sum of the element.
* `<=` - Check if the first matrix is smaller or equal then the other by sum of the element.
* `>=` - Check if the first matrix is bigger or equal then the other by sum of the element.
* `<<` - Printing the matrix.
* `>>` - Reading an input of matrix.
* `*` - Multiple the matrix with another matrix or scalar and returns new one.
* `*=` - Multiple the matrix with another matrix or scalar into the matrix.
* `-mat` - Return negative mat.
* `+` - Adding the matrix with another matrix or scalar and returns new one.
* `+=` - Adding the matrix with another matrix or scalar into the matrix.
* `-` - Subbing the matrix with another matrix or scalar and return new one.
* `-=` - Subbing the matrix with another matrix or scalar into the matrix.
