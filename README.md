# Matrix implementation C++

# Description
Implementation of matrix , included operators implementations.
The matrix has 3 private variables :
* rows
* cols
* vector<double>
  
# The goal:
  The goal of the project is to know how to implement some operators on C++ and know to use them for our goals.
  
Classes on this project :
                  
* **Matrix.hpp** - Functions and methods library.

* **Matrix.cpp** - Implementation of all the methods operators and functions.
                 
## Operators:
`==`
`!=`
`<`
`>`
`<=`
`>=`
`<<`
`>>`
`*`
`*=`
`-mat`
`+`
`+=`
